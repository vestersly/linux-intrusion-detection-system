# Collaboration & Attribution

This project was developed as part of a **collaborative security engineering engagement** carried out within a professional training environment.

The objective was to design, implement, and validate a **host-based intrusion detection capability** aligned with real-world operational security requirements.

## Project Context

- Team-based security engineering project
- Focused on defensive monitoring, automation, and alerting
- Tested and validated through simulated attack scenarios
- Environment and client-specific identifiers have been intentionally anonymized in accordance with responsible disclosure practices

## Team Contributions

This project was the result of a coordinated team effort:

- **Yuri** — Team Lead & System Monitoring  
  Oversight of monitoring strategy and validation approach

- **Sylvester Awungjia** — Core Architect  
  System integration, automation logic, testing, and operational validation

- **Patrick** — Log Analysis & User Auditing  
  Detection logic for authentication, authorization, and log anomalies

- **Asiye** — QA, Automation & Documentation  
  Validation workflows, testing consistency, and documentation support
